PyTorch implementation of ["Clonability of anti-counterfeiting printable graphical codes:
a machine learning approach"](http://sip.unige.ch/projects/snf-it-dis/publications/icassp-2019) 

The security of printable codes in terms of their reproducibility by unauthorized parties or clonability is largely unexplored. We try to investigate the clonability of printable graphical codes from a machine learning perspective. The proposed framework is based on a simple system composed of fully connected neural network layers. The results obtained on real codes printed by several printers demonstrate a possibility to accurately estimate digital codes from their printed counterparts in certain cases. This provides a new insight on scenarios, where printable graphical codes can be accurately cloned.
