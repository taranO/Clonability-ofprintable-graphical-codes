# Clonability of anti-counterfeiting printable graphical codes: a machine learning approach

The security of printable codes in terms of their reproducibility by unauthorized parties or clonability is largely unexplored. We try to investigate the clonability of printable graphical codes from a machine learning perspective. The proposed framework is based on a simple system composed of fully connected neural network layers. The results obtained on real codes printed by several printers demonstrate a possibility to accurately estimate digital codes from their printed counterparts in certain cases. This provides a new insight on scenarios, where printable graphical codes can be accurately cloned.
